# Atmospheric Correction
Scripts to modify [SeaDAS](https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/) for using [SS14](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.12.001) and [SSP](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.27.0A1118) algorithms.

*Note that these scripts are tested with [SeaDAS](https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/) v2020.1 and might need slight modifications to be used with newer versions.*


*To install these scripts in [SeaDAS](https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/), it should be compiled. The process to compile [SeaDAS](https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/) can be found [here](https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/build_ocssw/#building-the-code).*
